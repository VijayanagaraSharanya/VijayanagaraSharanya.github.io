                <!-- <h2>Ultimate goal:</h2> -->
                <p>Analyzing trends in shipping mode preferences over time could provide insights into shifting customer behavior and preferences. Regularly reviewing shipping mode performance will help inform logistics strategies and promotional efforts</p>
                <h2> Analysis of the graph: </h2>
                <p><b>The Standard Class</b> The Standard Class shipping mode has the highest sales volume, exceeding 1.4 million. This indicates that most customers prefer this shipping method, likely due to its balance of cost and delivery time</p>
                <p><b>The Second Class</b> shipping mode accounts for a significant amount of sales, but it is notably less than Standard Class. This could imply that while customers are willing to opt for a slower delivery option, they still prioritize affordability</p>
                <p><b>The First Class</b> shipping mode shows a moderate level of sales, while Same Day shipping has the least sales. This could suggest that customers are not inclined to pay for expedited shipping unless necessary.</p>
                <h2>Insights gained and Steps to be followed:</h2>  
                
            
                    <hr><b>Standard Class shipping </b> should continue to be the main focus due to its widespread use. This means that prompt delivery and effective logistics management are essential to its success. </br>
                    <b>Marketing for Second Class:</b> Given that Second Class also contributes significantly to sales, marketing initiatives should highlight the advantages of this affordable choice in order to draw in more clients.<br>
                    <b>Examine First Class and Same Day delivery: </b>Given that these delivery options have fewer sales, you could want to do research or customer surveys to find out what obstacles exist for these shipping options. Improving the value proposition for expedited delivery choices may persuade clients to select them.</p>

                <h2>Graph Showing Sales as per Segment of people and Category of Product</h2>
                <img src="images/sales_as_per_segment_and_cateogry.png" class="d-block w-300" alt="Graph 2">
            </br>
                <p>The pie chart suggests a healthy distribution of sales across the segments, with the Consumer and Corporate segments leading in total sales. Further analysis could be done to understand the reasons behind the sales distribution, such as customer behavior, product offerings, or market trends.</p>
                <h2>Analysis of the graph: </h2>
                <p><b>Consumer Segment:</b> The consumer segment seems to account for a sizable amount of overall sales, suggesting either large sales volume or robust demand in this category. 17.14% of all sales are displayed.</br>
                    <b>Corporate category:</b> With 17.73% of total revenues, this category also makes a significant contribution. This implies that a significant portion of revenues come from business clients.</br>
                    <b>Home Office Segment:</b> With 15.89% of total sales, the Home Office segment has the smallest share. In comparison to the other segments, this can suggest lower demand or a less concentrated marketing effort.
                    
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2> Insights Gained and Steps needs to be followed: </h2>
                    <p>Given that the Home Office segment's sales proportion is lower than that of the Consumer and Corporate sectors, initiatives targeted at these two markets may be more successful.
                        A balanced marketing strategy across all segments may also be advantageous, as the percentages show that each sector contributes considerably to overall sales.

                <br>
                <p>Technology appears to be the dominant category in terms of total sales, followed by Office Supplies and Furniture.
                    Furniture has the smallest overall sales compared to the other two categories.</p>
                    <h2>Analysis of the graph: </h2>
                    <p>Technology has a few customers with exceptionally high sales, potentially indicating the presence of large-scale projects or bulk purchases.
                        Office Supplies shows a more balanced distribution of sales among customers, suggesting a more consistent demand pattern.
                        Furniture has a relatively small number of customers with high sales, possibly due to the nature of furniture purchases (e.g., infrequent, high-value purchases)</p>

                <br>
                <p>Office Equipment (e.g., printers, copiers, binding machines) dominates the list of top-selling products.
                    Furniture (e.g., chairs, tables) has a few products in the top ranks.</p>
                    <h2>Analysis of the graph: </h2>
                    <p>Canon imageCLASS MF7460 Monochrome Digital Laser Multifunction Copier is the clear leader in terms of sales, significantly outselling other products.
                        Cisco TelePresence System EX90 Videoconferencing Unit and HON 5400 Series Task Chairs for Big and Tall also rank among the top-selling products.</p>
